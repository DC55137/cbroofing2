      "My partner and I recently had CB Metal Roofing install a new Unicote roof and were very happy overall with the experience. We received several quotes for the job ranging from exorbitant to reasonable (a large well-known company quoted us $50 thousand higher than the other quotes we received, and charged us $130 to do so without ever stepping foot on the roof). We ended up going with Chris because 1) he offered to move things around in his personal life to get the job done soon, and 2) my impression was that he was straightforward, hard-working and knows his business. Communication was generally through Daniel in the office, who was also easy to deal with, polite and responsive. The job was completed over two days, and the new roof looks great. We would definitely recommend Chris and his crew.",
